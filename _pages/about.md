I am a category theorist and mathematician. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/). My supervisor is [Emily Riehl](https://emilyriehl.github.io/).

I am a moderator on [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/), the question-and-answer sit for professional mathematicians. 

You can find my papers and preprints [on the arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Campion%2C+T).
